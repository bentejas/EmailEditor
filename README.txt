Hi! 

This is my open source solution for converting a large list of emails to a format that Outlook accepts. 

Sample input file will look like this: 

yourname@uwindsor.camyname@hotmail.comxyz@support.com...etc

Output will convert this list to a more readable format: yourname@uwindsor.ca, myname@hotmail.com, xyzsupport.com

JRE must be installed in order to use this program. Please ensure that the input file is within directory that the program file also resides in.

Any questions or comments please email me: ben@bentejas.com
